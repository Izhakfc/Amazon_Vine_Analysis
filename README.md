# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this project we analyzed Amazon Vine review program in order to determine if there is a bias toward favorable revies from Vine members.
The analysis was performed on video games and PysSpark was used in order to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset from AWS, transform the data with the desired columns that the client asked, connect to an AWS RDS instance and load the transformed data into pdAdmin and calculate different metrics.
## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
